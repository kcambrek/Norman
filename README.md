Norman story generator
Reddit has a plethora of surprising niche communities. One of my favourites is r/lifeofnorman. The subreddit is full of small stories written by community members on the mundane life of the protagonist Norman.

The goal of this notebook is to retrieve posts from the r/lifeofnorman, train a language generator model on these post and generate new stories. The language generator is already trained on a extremely large corpus and only needs to be fine-tuned. For more information on the language model, see https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/.

It is not necessary to collect the data and train the language generator everytime you use this notebook. If you mount your google drive to this notebook, you can save a model checkpoint which can be loaded in later sessions. Therefore, you only need to collect data and train the model once.

The syntax of the results seem to be sound, but the content can be a quite off. Some interesting results:
